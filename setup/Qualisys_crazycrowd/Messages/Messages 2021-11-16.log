1	13:41:57	Recalibration recommended	Cameras 1, 2 and 3 have very few contributions to the 3D reconstruction.
1	13:41:57	Certain active markers missing from measurement	These trajectories were connected to specific physical IDs of active markers, but those active markers were missing (or had the wrong ID settings):  Physical marker ID 1 for trajectory Crazyflie - 1 Physical marker ID 3 for trajectory Crazyflie - 2 Physical marker ID 2 for trajectory Crazyflie - 3 Physical marker ID 4 for trajectory Crazyflie - 4   If you don't want to use the physical IDs when identifying, uncheck the option "Use the physical IDs of active markers" in the AIM application settings.
